To create my web portfolio I used bootstrap, as I find it's the most efficient and easy way to create a responsive website. The most challening part of using bootstrap is finding out which column sizes to use. To overcome these challenges I use coding help websites, such as w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com. While creating this website I learned that bootstrap makes it very easy to create responsive images, as all you need to do is add a class of "img-fluid".
